  abstract = {We investigate the evolution of quantum information under Pauli measurement circuits. We focus on the case of one- and two-dimensional systems, which are relevant to the recently introduced Floquet topological codes. We define local reversibility in context of measurement circuits, which allows us to treat finite depth measurement circuits on a similar footing to finite depth unitary circuits. In contrast to the unitary case, a finite depth locally reversible measurement circuit can implement a translation in one dimension. A locally reversible measurement circuit in two dimensions may also induce a flow of logical information along the boundary. We introduce "measurement quantum cellular automata" which unifies these ideas and define an index in one dimension to characterize the flow of logical operators. We find a \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ bulk invariant for two-dimensional Floquet topological codes which indicates an obstruction to having a trivial boundary. We prove that the Hastings-Haah honeycomb code belongs to a class with such obstruction, which means that any boundary must have either nonlocal dynamics, period doubled, or admits anomalous boundary flow of quantum information.},

  abstract = {Quantum error correction provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. In this work, we present two surface code memories operating below this threshold: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ = 2.14 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.02 when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143\% \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.003\% error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit's lifetime by a factor of 2.4 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.3. We maintain below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 \${\textbackslash}mu\$s at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 \${\textbackslash}mu\$s. To probe the limits of our error-correction performance, we run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or 3 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 10\${\textasciicircum}9\$ cycles. Our results present device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.},

  abstract = {Quantum information is fragile and must be protected by a quantum error-correcting code for large-scale practical applications. Recently, highly efficient quantum codes have been discovered which require a high degree of spatial connectivity. This raises the question of how to realize these codes with minimal overhead under physical hardware connectivity constraints. Here, we introduce a general recipe to transform any quantum stabilizer code into a subsystem code with related code parameters that has weight and degree three, and local interactions on a given graph. We call the subsystem codes produced by our recipe "wire codes". These codes can be adapted to have a local implementation on any graph that supports a low-density embedding of an input tanner graph, with an overhead that depends on the embedding. Applying our results to hypercubic lattices leads to a construction of local subsystem codes with optimal scaling code parameters in any fixed spatial dimension. Similarly, applying our results to families of expanding graphs leads to local codes on these graphs with code parameters that depend on the degree of expansion. Our results constitute a general method to construct low-overhead subsystem codes on general graphs, which can be applied to adapt highly efficient quantum error correction procedures to hardware with restricted connectivity.},

We focus on models of topological fault tolerance - specifically surface codes - including circuit-based, measurement-based and fusion-based quantum computation, as well as the recently introduced model of Floquet codes. We find that all of these models can be viewed as different flavors of the same underlying stabilizer fault-tolerance structure, and sustain this through a set of local equivalence transformations which allow mapping between flavors. We anticipate that this unifying perspective will pave the way to transferring progress among the different views of stabilizer fault-tolerance and help researchers familiar with one model easily understand others.},

The scheme is based on the observation that the set of all possible outcome bit-strings of a Clifford circuit is a linear code, which we call the outcome code. From the outcome code we construct a corresponding stabilizer code, the spacetime code. Our construction extends the circuit-to-code construction of Bacon, Flammia, Harrow and Shi [2], revisited recently by Gottesman [16], to include intermediate and multi-qubit measurements. With this correspondence, we reduce the problem of correcting faults in a circuit to the well-studied problem of correcting errors in a stabilizer code. More precisely, a most likely error decoder for the spacetime code can be transformed into a most likely fault decoder for the circuit. We give efficient algorithms to construct the outcome and spacetime codes. We also identify conditions under which these codes are LDPC, and give an algorithm to generate low-weight checks, which can then be combined with effcient LDPC code decoders.},

  abstract = {Floquet codes are a novel class of quantum error-correcting codes with dynamically generated logical qubits arising from a periodic schedule of noncommuting measurements. We utilize the interpretation of measurements in terms of condensation of topological excitations and the rewinding of measurement sequences to engineer new examples of Floquet codes. In particular, rewinding is advantageous for obtaining a desired set of instantaneous stabilizer groups on both toric and planar layouts. Our first example is a Floquet code with instantaneous stabilizer codes that have the same topological order as the three-dimensional (3D) toric code(s). This Floquet code also exhibits a splitting of the topological order of the 3D toric code under the associated sequence of measurements, i.e., an instantaneous stabilizer group of a single copy of the 3D toric code in one round transforms into an instantaneous stabilizer group of two copies of the 3D toric code up to nonlocal stabilizers in the following round. We further construct boundaries for this 3D code and argue that stacking it with two copies of the 3D subsystem toric code allows for a transversal implementation of the logical non-Clifford controlled-controlled-{$Z$} gate. We also show that the coupled-layer construction of the X-cube Floquet code can be modified by a rewinding schedule such that each of the instantaneous stabilizer codes is finite depth equivalent to the X-cube model up to toric codes; the X-cube Floquet code exhibits a splitting of the X-cube model into a copy of the X-cube model and toric codes under the measurement sequence. Our final 3D example is a generalization of the 2D Floquet toric code on the honeycomb lattice to three dimensions, which has instantaneous stabilizer codes with the same topological order as the 3D fermionic toric code.},

Recently, there has been much interest in Floquet codes and space-time codes. In this work, we define and study the distance of a dynamical code. This is a subtle concept and difficult to determine: At any given time, the system will be in a subspace which forms a quantum error-correcting code with a given distance, but the full error correction capability of that code may not be available due to the schedule of measurements associated with the code. We address this challenge by developing an algorithm that tracks information we have learned about the error syndromes through the protocol and put that together to determine the distance of a dynamical code, in a non-fault-tolerant context. We use the tools developed for the algorithm to analyze the initialization and masking properties of a generic Floquet code. Further, we look at properties of dynamical codes under the constraint of geometric locality with a view to understand whether the fundamental limitations on logical gates and code parameters imposed by geometric locality for traditional codes can be surpassed in the dynamical paradigm. We find that codes with a limited number of long range connectivity will not allow non-Clifford gates to be implemented with finite depth circuits in the 2D setting.},

We estimate the infidelity of cultivation (from injection to idling at distance 15) using a mix of state vector simulation, stabilizer simulation, error enumeration, and Monte Carlo sampling. Compared to prior work, cultivation uses an order of magnitude fewer qubit-rounds to reach logical error rates as low as \$2 {\textbackslash}cdot 10{\textasciicircum}\{-9\}\$ when subjected to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ uniform depolarizing circuit noise. Halving the circuit noise to \$5 {\textbackslash}cdot 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ improves the achievable logical error rate to \$4 {\textbackslash}cdot 10{\textasciicircum}\{-11\}\$. Cultivation's efficiency and strong response to improvements in physical noise suggest that further magic state distillation may never be needed in practice.},

The field of quantum error correction has developed to meet this challenge.

  abstract = {We consider the {$\mathbb{Z}$}2 toric code, surface code, and Floquet code defined on a nonorientable surface, which can be considered as families of codes extending Shor's nine-qubit code. We investigate the fault-tolerant logical gates of the {$\mathbb{Z}$}2 toric code in this setup, which corresponds to {$e\leftrightarrowm$} exchanging symmetry of the underlying {$\mathbb{Z}$}2 gauge theory. We find that nonorientable geometry provides a new way for the emergent symmetry to act on the code space, and discover the new realization of the fault-tolerant Hadamard gate of the two-dimensional surface code with a single cross cap connecting the vertices nonlocally along a slit, dubbed a nonorientable surface code. This Hadamard gate can be realized by a constant-depth local unitary circuit modulo nonlocality caused by a cross cap. Via folding, the nonorientable surface code can be turned into a bilayer local quantum code, where the folded cross cap is equivalent to a bilayer twist terminated on a gapped boundary and the logical Hadamard only contains local gates with intralayer couplings when being away from the cross cap, as opposed to the interlayer couplings on each site needed in the case of the folded surface code. We further obtain the complete logical Clifford gate set for a stack of nonorientable surface codes and similarly for codes defined on Klein-bottle geometries. We then construct the honeycomb Floquet code in the presence of a single cross cap, and find that the period of the sequential Pauli measurements acts as a {$H$}⁢{$Z$} logical gate on the single logical qubit, where the cross cap enriches the dynamics compared with the orientable case. We find that the dynamics of the honeycomb Floquet code is precisely described by a condensation operator of the {$\mathbb{Z}$}2 gauge theory, and illustrate the exotic dynamics of our code in terms of a condensation operator supported at a nonorientable surface.},

In particular, we improve on the standard circuit constructions for the surface code, presenting new circuits that can embed on a hexagonal grid instead of a square grid, that can use ISWAP gates instead of CNOT or CZ gates, that can exchange qubit data and measure roles, and that move logical patches around the physical qubit grid while executing. All these constructions use no additional entangling gate layers and display essentially the same logical performance, having teraquop footprints within 25\% of the standard surface code circuit. We expect these circuits to be of great interest to quantum hardware engineers, because they achieve essentially the same logical performance as standard surface code circuits while relaxing demands on hardware.},

The surface code and its variants have been considered the most promising quantum error correction scheme due to their high threshold, low overhead, and relatively simple structure that can naturally be implemented in many existing qubit architectures, such as superconducting qubits. The recent development of Floquet codes by Hastings and Haah offers another promising approach. By going beyond the usual paradigm of stabilizer codes, Floquet codes achieve similar performance while being constructed entirely from two-qubit measurements. This makes them particularly suitable for platforms where two-qubit measurements can be implemented directly, such as the measurement-only topological qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs) proposed by Karzig et al. Here, we explain how two variants of Floquet codes can be implemented on MZM-based architectures without any auxiliary qubits for syndrome measurement and with shallow syndrome-extraction sequences. We then numerically demonstrate their favorable performance. In particular, we show that they improve the threshold for scalable quantum computation in MZM-based systems by an order of magnitude and significantly reduce space and time overheads below threshold.},

  abstract = {Dynamical quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) offer a wider possibilities in how one can protect logical quantum information from noise and perform fault-tolerant quantum computation compared to static QECCs. A family of dynamical codes called the ``Floquet codes'' consists of a periodic sequence of two-qudit measurements from which one can correct errors on many-body systems, relaxing the requirement for hardware implementations. Existing results on Floquet codes has been focused on qubits, two-level quantum systems, with very little attention given on higher dimensional quantum systems, or qudits. We bridge this gap by proposing a simple, yet general construction of qudit Floquet codes based on a simple set of conditions on the sequence two-body measurements defining the code. Moreover, this construction applies to a large family of configurations of qudits on the vertices of a three-colorable lattice which connectivity represented by the edges. We show that this construction includes the existing constructions of both qubit and qudit Floquet codes as special cases. In addition, any qudit Floquet code obtained by our construction achieves a rate of encoded logical qudits over physical qudits approaching \${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\$ as the number of physical qudits in total and on the faces of the lattice grows larger, as opposed to vanishing rate in existing qudit Floquet code constructions.},

For a stabilizer code of distance \$d\$ that can correct up to \$t={\textbackslash}lfloor(d-1)/2{\textbackslash}rfloor\$ errors, the traditional Shor scheme handles ancilla preparation and measurement faults by performing syndrome measurements until the syndromes are repeated \$t+1\$ times in a row; in the worst-case scenario, \$(t+1){\textasciicircum}2\$ rounds of measurements are required. In this work, we improve the Shor FTEC scheme using an adaptive syndrome measurement technique. The syndrome for error correction is determined based on information from the differences of syndromes obtained from consecutive rounds. Our protocols that satisfy the strong and the weak FTEC conditions require no more than \$(t+3){\textasciicircum}2/4-1\$ rounds and \$(t+3){\textasciicircum}2/4-2\$ rounds, respectively, and are applicable to any stabilizer code. Our simulations of FTEC protocols with the adaptive schemes on hexagonal color codes of small distances verify that our protocols preserve the code distance, can increase the pseudothreshold, and can decrease the average number of rounds compared to the traditional Shor scheme. We also find that for the code of distance \$d\$, our FTEC protocols with the adaptive schemes require no more than \$d\$ rounds on average.},

However, the most striking feature of the Kitaev model is its intrinsic fractionalization of quantum spins into an emergent gauge field and itinerant Majorana fermions that form a Dirac liquid, which is absent in the Floquet code. Here we demonstrate that by varying the measurement strength of the honeycomb Floquet code one can observe features akin to the fractionalization physics of the Kitaev model at finite temperature. Introducing coherent errors to weaken the measurements we observe three consecutive stages that reveal qubit fractionalization (for weak measurements), the formation of a Majorana liquid (for intermediate measurement strength), and Majorana pairing together with gauge ordering (for strong measurements). Our analysis is based on a mapping of the imperfect Floquet code to random Gaussian fermionic circuits (networks) that can be Monte Carlo sampled, exposing two crossover peaks. With an eye on circuit implementations, our analysis demonstrates that the Floquet code, in contrast to the toric code, does not immediately break down to a trivial state under weak measurements, but instead gives way to a long-range entangled Majorana liquid state.},
